  "mitigation": "As the bluetooth module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install bluetooth /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-bluetooth.conf \nThe system will need to be restarted if the bluetooth modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the bluetooth kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any bluetooth interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

    "Devices supporting Bluetooth before 5.1 may allow man-in-the-middle attacks, aka BLURtooth. Cross Transport Key Derivation in Bluetooth Core Specification v4.2 and v5.0 may permit an unauthenticated user to establish a bonding with one transport, either LE or BR/EDR, and replace a bonding already established on the opposing transport, BR/EDR or LE, potentially overwriting an authenticated key with an unauthenticated key, or a key with greater entropy with one with less.",
    "A flaw was found in the bluetooth specification that would allow an attacker within bluetooth radio range to abuse a protocol flaw which could allow key-overwrite in services."
