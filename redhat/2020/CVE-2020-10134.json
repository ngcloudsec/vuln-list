  "details": [
    "Pairing in Bluetooth? Core v5.2 and earlier may permit an unauthenticated attacker to acquire credentials with two pairing devices via adjacent access when the unauthenticated user initiates different pairing methods in each peer device and an end-user erroneously completes both pairing procedures with the MITM using the confirmation number of one peer as the passkey of the other. An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able to initiate any Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user must authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-local protections may be weakened.",
    "A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooth protocol affecting the Bluetooth LE Secure Connections pairing and the BR/EDR Secure Simple Pairing. An attacker with physical access to the Bluetooth connection could perform a man-in-the-middle attack between two devices using the Numeric Comparison and Passkey pairing association models. This attack may result in the man-in-the-middle becoming authenticated with the attacked devices and being able to initiate any Bluetooth operation exposed by the enabled Bluetooth profiles."
