  "details": [
    "In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2 there is a bug in which the `alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart. This issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is to manually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart, verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does not contain newlines or path characters."
