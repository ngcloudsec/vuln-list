  "statement": "Although Red Hat Ansible Tower ships the flawed code, it does not use the vulnerable function i.e. \"MultiPartParser\" and therefore will not be updated.\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure ship affected version of python-django however RHUI v3 is in maintenance support phase and we are only fixing critical and important fixes. Please refer RHUI support lifecycle page for more information: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/rhui.\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-django package.",

  "name": "CVE-2021-28658",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Django 2.2 before 2.2.20, 3.0 before 3.0.14, and 3.1 before 3.1.8, MultiPartParser allowed directory traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names. Built-in upload handlers were not affected by this vulnerability.",
    "A flaw was found in Django. This flaw allows an attacker to upload specially-named files and exploit a flaw in the `MultiPartParser()` function to traverse directories. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
