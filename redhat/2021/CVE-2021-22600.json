In order to exploit this issue the attacker needs CAP_NET_RAW capability, which needs to be granted by the administrator to the attacker's account. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 does not have unprivileged user namespaces enabled by default, so local unprivileged users also cannot abuse namespaces feature to grant this capability to themselves and elevate their privileges.",
