    "An issue was discovered in fig2dev before 3.2.8.. A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function compute_closed_spline() located in trans_spline.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service. The fixed version of fig2dev is 3.2.8.",
    "The transfig package is susceptible to a NULL pointer dereference on crafted input. While translating fig code, patterns which include incomplete closed splines lead to this software flaw. The highest threat from this vulnerability is availability."
