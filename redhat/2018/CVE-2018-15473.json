    "A user enumeration vulnerability flaw was found in OpenSSH, though version 7.7. The vulnerability occurs by not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticated user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
