  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Kubernetes, where users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane network. Kubernetes supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods, retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in the kube-apiserver made it possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation allows authenticated requests destined for Nodes to redirect to the API Server through its private network."
