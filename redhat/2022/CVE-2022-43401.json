    "A sandbox bypass vulnerability involving various casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime in Jenkins Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.",
    "A sandbox bypass vulnerability was found in several Jenkins plugins. This could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins JVM controller. Exploitation could be achieved by crafting untrusted libraries or pipelines, compromising the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of Jenkins."
