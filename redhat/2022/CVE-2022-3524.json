  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is the function ipv6_renew_options of the component IPv6 Handler. The manipulation leads to memory leak. The attack can be launched remotely. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211021 was assigned to this vulnerability.",
    "A memory leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel?s IPv6 functionality in how a user triggers the setsockopt of the IPV6_ADDRFORM and IPV6_DSTOPTS type. This flaw allows a user to crash the system if the setsockopt function is being called simultaneously with the IPV6_ADDRFORM type and other processes with the IPV6_DSTOPTS type. This issue is unlikely to happen unless a local process triggers IPV6_ADDRFORM."
