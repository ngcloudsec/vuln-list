    "A possible escalation to RCE vulnerability exists when using YAML serialized columns in Active Record \u003c 7.0.3.1, \u003c6.1.6.1, \u003c6.0.5.1 and \u003c5.2.8.1 which could allow an attacker, that can manipulate data in the database (via means like SQL injection), the ability to escalate to an RCE.",
    "An insecure deserialization flaw was found in Active Record, which uses YAML.unsafe_load to convert the YAML data into Ruby objects. An attacker supplying crafted data to the database can perform remote code execution (RCE), resulting in complete system compromise."
