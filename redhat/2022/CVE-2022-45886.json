    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 6.0.9. drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_net.c has a .disconnect versus dvb_device_open race condition that leads to a use-after-free.",
    "A race condition flaw leading to a use-after-free issue was found in the Linux kernel media subsystem in the dvb_net component of the DVB core device driver. It could occur between the time the device is disconnected (.disconnect function)  and the time the device node is opened (dvb_device_open function). A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."
