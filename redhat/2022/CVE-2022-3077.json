    "A buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel Intel?s iSMT SMBus host controller driver in the way it handled the I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_PROC_CALL case (via the ioctl I2C_SMBUS) with malicious input data. In particular, the userspace controllable \"data-\u003eblock[0]\" variable was not capped to a number between 0-255 and then used as the size of a memcpy, thus possibly writing beyond the end of dma_buffer. This flaw could allow a privileged local user to crash the system."
