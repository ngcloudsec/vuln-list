    "A flaw was found in ruby gem-rack. This flaw allows a malicious actor to craft requests that can cause shell escape sequences to be written to the terminal via rack's `Lint` middleware and `CommonLogger` middleware. This issue can leverage these escape sequences to execute commands in the victim's terminal."
