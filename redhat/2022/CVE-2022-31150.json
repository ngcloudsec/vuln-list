    "undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. It is possible to inject CRLF sequences into request headers in undici in versions less than 5.7.1. A fix was released in version 5.8.0. Sanitizing all HTTP headers from untrusted sources to eliminate `\\r\\n` is a workaround for this issue.",
    "A flaw was found in the undici package. When requesting an input on an unsanitized request path, method, or headers it is possible to inject Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) sequences into these requests."
