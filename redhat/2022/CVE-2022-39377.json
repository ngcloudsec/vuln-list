    "sysstat is a set of system performance tools for the Linux operating system. On 32 bit systems, in versions 9.1.16 and newer but prior to 12.7.1, allocate_structures contains a size_t overflow in sa_common.c. The allocate_structures function insufficiently checks bounds before arithmetic multiplication, allowing for an overflow in the size allocated for the buffer representing system activities. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This issue has been patched in version 12.7.1.",
    "An arithmetic overflow issue was discovered in Sysstat on 32-bit systems. The allocate_structures() function in sa_common.c insufficiently checks bounds before arithmetic multiplication, allowing an overflow in the size allocated for the buffer representing system activities. The vulnerability can be triggered when displaying activity data files and may lead to memory corruption or possibly arbitrary code execution due to an incorrectly sized buffer."
