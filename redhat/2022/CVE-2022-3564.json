  "mitigation": "To mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level, disable the Bluetooth functionality via blocklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Instructions on how to disable Bluetooth modules are available on the Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931.\nAlternatively, Bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at BIOS level which will also provide an effective mitigation as the kernel will not be able to detect that Bluetooth hardware is present on the system.",

    "A vulnerability classified as critical was found in Linux Kernel. Affected by this vulnerability is the function l2cap_reassemble_sdu of the file net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c of the component Bluetooth. The manipulation leads to use after free. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The associated identifier of this vulnerability is VDB-211087.",
    "A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel?s L2CAP bluetooth functionality in how a user triggers a race condition by two malicious flows in the L2CAP bluetooth packets. This flaw allows a local or bluetooth connection user to crash the system or potentially escalate privileges."
