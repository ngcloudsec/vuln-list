    "A sandbox bypass vulnerability in Jenkins Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b_454e43966 and earlier allows attackers with permission to define untrusted Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.",
    "A sandbox bypass vulnerability was found in several Jenkins plugins. This could allow an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins JVM controller. Exploitation could be achieved by crafting untrusted libraries or pipelines, compromising the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of Jenkins."
