    "** DISPUTED ** Unbound before 1.9.5 allows an integer overflow in the regional allocator via the ALIGN_UP macro. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability. Although the code may be vulnerable, a running Unbound installation cannot be remotely or locally exploited.",
    "A flaw was found in unbound. An integer overflow in the regional allocator via the ALIGN_UP macro may lead to a buffer overflow if the size can be controlled by an attacker. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability."
